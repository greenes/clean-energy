Each year, U.S. utilities and factories waste enough heat to power all of Japan for that year.

In other words, two-thirds of the fuel we use to generate power is wasted. It is released into the environment as heat through cooling towers. This is incredibly inefficient, if only there was a way to capture this wasted heat and put it to use....well there is! It is technology called combinded heat and power, and its been around for over 100 years, and currently supplies 12% of America's energy needs.

Combined heat and power systems, known as CHP, capture waste heat from manufacturing, power generation, and other industrial processes and use it to generate electricity or to heat and cool nearby buildings, providing significant efficiency benefits, cost savings, and reduced emissions. 

The first modern use of this technology was implemented by Thomas Edison. His 1882 Pearl Street Station, the world’s first commercial power plant, was a combined heat and power plant, the facility itself produced both electricity and thermal energy while using waste heat to provide warmth to neighboring buildings. Recycling the energy that would have otherwise been wasted allowed Edison’s plant to achieve approximately 50 percent efficiency.  12

But, in the early 1900s, U.S. regulations emerged to promote rural electrification through the construction of centralized power plants managed by regional utilities. But, CHP is distributed, or onsite, power generation, it does not rely on a centralized power generator. Consequently, CHP technology fell by the wayside in America's centralized power generation model.

Today, with higher energy costs, resilliency concerns from super-storms, potential electrical grid attacks, and with goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, combined heat and power is being given a second look. 

The benefits of CHP are manyfold

For the energy consumer:
-	 CHP reduces energy costs for consumers because more power and/or heat can be produced with less fuel.
-	 CHP reduces the risk of electric grid disruptions and enhances energy reliability for the user. This is
particularly useful for hospitals, military installations, research institutions, or industrial facilities where keeping the power running 24/7 is critial.
-	 CHP provides predictability in the face of uncertain electricity prices.

For the United States as a whole:
-	 CHP offers a low-cost approach to adding new electricity generation capacity.
-  CHP puts off the need for investments in new large central power plants, new transmission and
distribution infrastructures, helping to minimize increases in electricity costs.
-	 CHP uses highly-skilled local labor and American technology. A significant increase in industrial energy efficiency could create as many as 1 million highly skilled jobs, according to Oak Ridge National Laboratory

- the potential for CHP exists in every state
A recent report, funded in part by Department of Energy, suggests that CHP could represent as much as 20% of U.S. electric generation capacity by 2030, or 241 GW of total capacity. Although the type of energy resources vary significantly by region and state, CHP can provide efficiency across the country, regardless of the native energy sources of a particular region. CHP, which is flexible and scalable, can be applied at a wide range of industrial, commercial, and institutional facilities that require round-the-clock power.

- CHP deployment is financially viable in every state
When CHP systems have parity with conventional power generation in financial incentives, the technology becomes viable in every state. Across the country, utilities are beginning to embrace these highly efficient systems and to effectively plan for their incorporation, thereby spurring more widespread deployment.

- CHP allows industries to better compete in the global economy
Energy-intensive U.S. industries compete better in the global marketplace when they can lower operational costs, which investments in CHP can support. Improving the efficiency of power generation could result in more than $200 billion in private investment over 10 years.

- CHP improves grid reliability by reducing peak load
On-site electric generation, like CHP, reduces grid congestion by reducing the number of entitites connected to the grid. This improves the reliability of the electricity distribution system. Because CHP facilities are typically located on-site or close to consumers, it is faster to deliver electricity to customers, and less electricity is lost along the way, and becuase there are less customers per generation source, there is less demand to bog down the system. 

- CHP enhances energy security and resiliency
Compared with large, centralized, interconnected grids, CHP is more resilient when weather or security events interrupt energy supplies. Many facilities can come online quickly after outages and are "island-able", or can operate off the grid during a blackout since they create their own power and heat on site. These attributes allow businesses to keep the lights on and to keep critical infrastructure powered and operations running.

- Finally, CHP reduces emissions of GHGs and other air pollutants by 40 percent or more, and can operate at efficiency levels of 80% or more.


Case Studies:

When Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, the electricity generated by the gas turbine CHP system at Baptist Medical Center in Jackson, MS, enabled the hospital to maintain patient care— It was the only one in the area able to do so on the first night of the disaster. Despite the widespread grid failure, the hospital provided electricity, hot water, and cooling services to nearby residents in need. 

Similarly, during the August 2003 blackout that affected parts of the Midwest and Northeast and resulted in nationwide economic losses of nearly $10 billion, many manufacturers and food processors with CHP systems stayed open while the rest of the area was without power for up to 10 days.

In 2012, more than 8 million people lost power in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic during the
devastation inflicted by Hurricane Sandy. But those communities, institutions, hospitals, and businesses that
had invested in CHP generation systems were able to keep the lights and heat on, providing refuge for residents, emergency workers and also maintaining essential operations. Co-op City in the Bronx, NY, Salem Community College, and Princeton
University in New Jersey, and New Milford and Danbury hospitals in Connecticut were among a handful of
institutions that maintained critical functions by generating their own electricity with CHP.
 


So why doesn't every hospital, military base, hotel, apartment building, etc. have their own CHP system?

Barriers to CHP deployment:



Generally the upfront costs for the system creates a high barrer for entry. The systems are labor intensive and costly to install and maintain.

lack of incentives - Federal, state, and local incentives for other energy technologies and sources energy are often higher that those for CHP. 

Some places have laws requiring any entitity that generates electricity to classify as a utility and therefore obtain numerous expensive permits and follow a new set of rules and regulations specifically for utilities, detering places from wanting to generate their own power.

Education - many people are unfamiliar with the technology and do not know the benefits it could provide them, so they go with technologies they know

So, there you have a quick overview of what CHP technology is, what it can do, and the benefits it can provide. To help reinforce the concepts, I have a quick video.
